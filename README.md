# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard

I just completed my Excel dashboard project, analyzing coffee shop sales data. This project involved cleaning and transforming the data, extracting important new columns, using pivot tables, formulas, and charts, and formatting it to create an insightful dashboard. Hereâ€™s an overview:

# Main KPIs:

Total Sales

Footfall

Average Bill

Average Order

# Charts Used:

Line Chart: Often used for date and time trends.
Bar Chart: Identifying the top 5 products based on sales.
Clustered Column Chart: Analyzing day-wise orders and sales, and footfall and sales across various store locations.
Donut Chart: Showing Size wise order ratio and Store wise Sales.

# Filters:

Day
Month

# Highlights:

Most orders are placed in the morning, between 7-10 a.m.
Barista Espresso is the top choice for customers.
Coffee and tea generate the highest sales.
Small-sized products are the least preferred.
Saturdays have the fewest orders.
Average order numbers are unsatisfactory for the business.
Key Takeaways for Your Excel Projects:

Use Power Query Editor in Excel for connecting to different data sources, and for data cleaning and transformation.
Remove white spaces during data cleaning as they can be part of the raw data.
Enable the Developer and Power Pivot Ribbons in Excel for more effective data analysis.
